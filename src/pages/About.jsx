            <p className="p-3">As a kid I was always into electronics, computers especially. As I am sure we all were at some point, I was the go to I.T. person in my house. When all we really did was restart the router haha. I always wanted to know more about what was going on inside my computer and why it wasnt as fast as I wanted it to be so I would go off to highschool and join a new course called Cisco: Intro to Technology. While in that class I found a new liking to Computers, mostly the hardware part of things and went off to help build computers with my nephews and friends, made ethernet cables that I would use for my xbox and router. From there I went off to working full time and managing a couple of places and thought I needed some change. I started the Bootcamp with Rutgers and found myself loving hte ins and outs of computers all over again. Thoughout the Bootcamp I started to lean towards Frontend Development and thats where I want to basic my focus on now.</p>
